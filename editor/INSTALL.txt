How to run the AtrinikEditor:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Simply run the jar file "AtrinikEditor.jar" in the main directory.
In Windows this is done by a doubleclick on "AtrinikEditor.jar".
In Linux/Unix you type in the console: "java -jar AtrinikEditor.jar".

The java runtime will be enough to run the client. Download it automatically
from sun. This will install the latest runtime using your browser.

** There is no neeed to install anything else (SDK, ...) except you want   **
** compile the editor                                                      **

You can download the java RUNTIME here:

or this
http://java.com

If you have enough memory, it is recommended to run the editor
with a higher maximum memory size, like 128 Mb:
"java -jar -Xmx128m AtrinikEditor.jar"
(Note that in this way, the editor won't *always* use 128 Mb.
It will only use that much when it is required.)


In case there is no jar file available, that means you will need
to compile the editor from the sources first. Read next paragraph.


How to build the AtrinikEditor from sources:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you have checked out the AtrinikEditor sources from CVS, or
downloaded a "developer version", then you've got the java sources.
Now you can modify the java code, you can add classes, but please
don't move or rename any directories.

When you find yourself in the position that you want to compile
the java sources for the editor, you have mainly these options:

1. Compile & Debug using JBuilder.
2. Compile using Apache Ant.
3. Compile using one of the OS-specific build scripts.
   (There is no guarantee any of these works correctly.)
4. Compile "by hand" via commandline.

I strongly recommed using Ant for compile and JBuilder for coding & compile.
It works on any reasonable platform and comes even pre-installed on most 
Linux/Unix systems today. JBuilder is free avaible for personal use from
Borland.

Visit <http://ant.apache.org/> for more information about Ant.
Visit <http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_jbuilder.html> 
for more information about Borland JBuilder.

Using Borland JBuilder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Read the README.TXT in Atrinik/editor/make/jbuilder9/ for more
info. On the Borland site is also a big doc file (>70mb). If 
JBUilder is installed, just start the AtrinikEditor.jpx inside
the folder.

Compiling the sources with Apache Ant:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Install Ant on your system. Make sure both the JAVA_HOME
and ANT_HOME environment variables are set correctly.

Change into the AtrinikEditor "make" directory. (Your
directory structure has to be exactly as taken from CVS,
especially the "arch" directory must be present.)

On the console type "ant" - that's all.

(Note that, if you want, you can also run the editor with
ant by typing "ant run". This does exactly the same as
"java -jar -Xmx128m AtrinikEditor.jar".)

System requirements & Supported Java Versions:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You need at least 128 MB of system RAM and 400 MHz CPU speed
in order to run the AtrinikEditor. It has been reported to work
on systems with lesser specs, but the speed was very slow.

The editor has been developed and tested for Java SDK 1.3, 1.4 and
1.5 from SUN. It will not run on Java versions 1.2 and lower.
It has been successfully tested on multiple platforms
including windows (98/2k/XP), linux and unix (solaris).
