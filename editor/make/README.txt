Directions for compiling the java editor:

NOTE: Atrinik will come with a AtrinikEditor.jar file
in the Atrinik/editor/ folder. This is the compiled
java editor and it can be started like any other application
when the java SDK or runtime is installed. Under Windows or
X-Window should a simple mouse click do it. If the editor
not starts up the problem is a not right configured java 
system. Read the java install doc and set your path names.
The it should run out of the box.

In any case before you can run the editor, you need to
install a java SDK. It is recommended to install the 
Java 2 SDK version 1.4 from sun.  Version 1.3 works as well.
Anything older than 1.3 won't work. 

For compiling the editor, in the Atrinik/editor/make/ folder are
some make and build files from different system. It is recommended
to use the ant builder or the JBuilder. Read the README.TXT in the
sub folders of the system you like to use to compile the editor.

See also "INSTALL.txt" in the editor's main directory.
