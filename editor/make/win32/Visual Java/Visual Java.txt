On Windows, it is also possible to compile and run the DaimoninEditor
with Virtual J++. However, this requires some special settings because
Visual J++ initially has only the classes from JDK 1.1.
Open a new Project "DaimoninEditor" and include all the *.java files.
Make sure the mainclass is set to DaimoninEditor.java.
Then select the menu "Project->DaimoninEditor Properties...".
In this dialog you must set "Launch" to custom, program: "javaw.exe".
You must also add a new "Classpath", containing the absolute path
to a file called "rt.jar", from the SDK 1.3.1 installation (from sun,
see above). The path might look similar to this:
"C:\...\Java_SDK\jre\lib\rt.jar"
Then press <Strg>+<F5> to compile and execute.
