Using Borland JBuilder for compiling the Editor

The JBuilder is free for personal use and can
be downloaded from Borland. A registration key will
be send from them by email. 

Visit <http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_jbuilder.html> 
for more information about Borland JBuilder.

After installation just start the or load the DaimoninEditor.jpx file
and hit "make project" from Project.

Note: After the first start of DaimoninEditor.jpx you will see some
warning messages about missing packages. This happens because the 
source comes without any generated project files from JBuilder. 
They will be generated when the JBuilder compiles the project
a first time - the warning messages will disappear then.

The JBuilder will create every compile the jar file too.
If you want code, you can disable it and start the project
with "run project" right from the class files. This will safe
some time on slower system. On a 2.54Ghz Intel the compile
& jar file creation needs around 5 seconds.

See also "INSTALL.txt" in the editor's main directory.
