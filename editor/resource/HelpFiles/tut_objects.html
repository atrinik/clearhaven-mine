<P> Simple maps can be created just by using the default objects from the
left-side window. Though, if you want to create real cool maps,
you will need to modify these objects very often, to suit your needs.</P>

<P>The object's in-game appearance and functionality is defined by many
different attributes (object-type, name, resistances, ... etc).
If you want to change the attributes of an object, you have two options:</P>

<ol>
<LI><b>Use the convenient attribute interface</b><br>
    <br>
    Select the object you want to modify, then doubleclick on it in the
    <A HREF="tut_frames.html">Map-Archpanel Window</A> (on the right side).
    You could alternatively select it and press the "Attributes" button on the
    <A HREF="tut_frames.html">Object Attribute Window</A>.
    A popup window will appear, containing all object attributes in a
    graphical user interface.<br>
    Keep in mind that the syntax definitions for this entire thing are written in
    well-readable XML. So if you notice that some attribute is wrong,
    or missing, I strongly recommed you trying to edit the definitions file: "types.xml".<br><br>

<LI><b>Modify the archtext directly</b><br>
    <br>
    Select the object you want, then modify the attributes
    directly in the <A HREF="tut_frames.html">Archtext Window</A> (in the
    bottom-right corner).<br>
    But beware! You need to know exactly what you are doing there.
    If you do typos or set wrong values, you won't receive a warning.
    Modifying the archtext directly is adviseable for more experienced
    mapmakers only.
