<P>Some treasurelists are used for special purposes. These can be found in
the subfolders "God Intervention", "Dragon Player Evolution" and "Player Creation".
They cannot be used in maps.
</P>
<P>
The "God Intervention" lists are of special importance. They define which
bonuses the Daimonin gods donate to their worshippers. These lists are
traveresed from top to bottom and the grace_limit objects are only passed
when the worshipping player has a certain amount of grace.
</P>
<P>
Below you see the treasurelist of the god Gnarg (as of 24.10.2002,
the list might have changed in the meantime).
