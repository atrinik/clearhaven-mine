<H1 align=center>Daimonin Java Editor FAQ</H1>

<P><B>The map is displayed in a weird wrong shape. Is this a bug?</B></P>
<P> No certainly not. Under the menu "Map->Map Properties", you have to adjust the
setting of the checkbox "Show Isometric". It must be disabled for rectangular
arches, and enabled for iso arches. You should also adjust the global iso
setting under "File->Options..." accordingly.
</P>

<P><B>Where can I get the latest version of the JavaEditor?</B></P>
<P>The best source is &lt;http://mids.student.utwente.nl/~avogl/CFJavaEditor&gt;.
This is my personal page and I usually care about it. You'll find notes about
recent updates and the changes being made. Anyways, please keep in mind that
I'm only a student. I don't always have time, nor do I own that domain.
So it certainly could happen that it is down sometimes or not perfectly up-to-date.
</P>
<P>Another good (and the most relyable) source is Daimonin's CVS repository. Go to
&lt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/daimonin/&gt; and try to figure out
how to do an anonymous checkout. The package is called "CFJavaEditor".
</P>
<P>
The third possibility is you get an official release version. For that you
can either look on Sourceforge or &lt;http://daimonin.real-time.com&gt;.
</P>

<P><B>The editor has successfully loaded the arches, but all the images are
missing. WTF?</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><P>If you are using up-to-date Daimonin arches, these support
multiple image sets. Select menu "File->Options" and make sure
the entry "Use Image Set" is set to "Base".
If you are using old arches, or iso arches, make sure the entry
"Use Image Set" is set to "Disabled".
If your settings were wrong then restart the editor after correction.
</P>
<LI><P>Another possibility is that you have compiled the editor in a weird
wrong way, missing to include the files of the sixlegs png library "png.jar".
</P>
</UL>

<P><B>Whenever I start the JavaEditor, I get a bunch of errormessages
concerning some missing font. What does that mean?</B></P>
<P>That appears to happen with several linux distributions.
The messages might be annoying, but it's completely harmless.
Simply ignore it. If using Java SDK version 1.3, upgrading to 1.4 might
resolve the problem and maybe even get you a better-looking default font.
</P>

<P><B>My CPU is too slow for this program, and my memory doesn't suffice...
and my display has only 256 colors. What can I do?</B></P>
<P>Let's see... Buy a new computer? :-)<br>
Now seriously, I'm sorry that this program requires a certain level of
system performance - But I can't help it. I have invested big amounts of
time to make everything run as fast as possible and with least
Memory consumtion.
