<H1 align=center>Cut/Copy/Paste and Fill</H1>

<P>Often you will want to copy, move, delete or fill large areas of your map.
To accomplish this, you can use the appropriate commands from the Edit-menu.
</P>

<P><B>Clear:</B><br>
By activating the Clear-command, everything in the currently selected area
of the map will be deleted. Unlike for the Cut-command, the copy buffer
remains unchanged.
</P>

<P><B>Cut:</B><br>
By activating the Cut-command, everything in the currently selected area
of the map will be deleted and stored into the copy buffer.
</P>

<P><B>Copy:</B><br>
By activating the Copy-command, everything in the currently selected area
is stored into the copy buffer. The map itself remains unchanged. <br>
(Note that multipart objects will usually be copied only when their
"head"-tile is located within the selected area. Since the position of this
"head"-tile differs, expect some strange behaviour there.)
</P>

<P><B>Paste:</B><br>
The paste command allows to dump the contents of the copy buffer onto the map.
First, select a square on the map to be the topleft corner of the
pasted area. Anything which doesn't fit within the borders of the map
will not get pasted. Multipart objects which would reach outside of the map
borders, and be it only with their small toe, don't get pasted either.
</P>

<P><B>Fill:</B><br>
There are two fill comands: "Fill Below" and "Fill Above". The difference
between those two should be pretty obvious: If any selected map squares are not
empty, the new arches will get inserted either above top (-&gt; Fill Above),
or below bottom (-&gt; Fill below).
</P>
<P>Both fill commands can be used in two different ways:
<ol>
  <LI> Select *one* empty square and hit fill: All empty squares
  adjacent to the selected one will get floodfilled.
  <LI> Select an area or a non-empty square: The currently selected
  default arch will be inserted ontop of (or below) every square within the
  selected area.
</ol>
