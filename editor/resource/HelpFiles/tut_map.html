<H1 align=center>Basics for Designing a Map</H1>

<P>Once you have opened a map, you can start to shape and modify it.
You can do the following actions with your mouse:
<UL>
  <LI>left mouse button: select object(s)
  <LI>right mouse button: insert an object
  <LI>middle mouse button: delete an object
</UL>
If your mouse has less than three buttons, you can simulate the missing
buttons by holding &lt;shift&gt; or &lt;ctrl&gt;:<br>
right-click = "click & &lt;shift&gt;" and middle-click = "click & &lt;ctrl&gt;".
</P>

<P>
To <B>select</B> an object, left click on it. You can do so either on the map
window or in the map-archpanel window to the right.
If you want to select a group of squares on the map (e.g. for copy/paste actions),
left click and drag. You will notice a rectangular area getting highlighted as
you drag.
</P>

<P>
To <B>insert</B> a new object, you must first select one of the arches from the
default-archpanel to the left. Right click to insert the selected arch
into the map. You can also right-click into the map-archpanel in order to
insert the object at a specific place in a pile of objects.
You can drag the mouse on the map view in order to insert the same arch
on many squares.
</P>

<P>
To <B>delete</B> an object, simply middle click on it. You can drag the mouse to
delete multiple objects. Deleting specific objects out of a stack is
possible by middle-clicking in the map-archpanel.<br>
(If your mouse has no middle-button you can simulate it by pressing
&lt;Strg&gt;+&lt;any mouse button&gt;.)
</P>

<P>
There is a convenience function for inserting walls into a map: The
"<B>auto joining</B>"-feature. Activate the checkbox in the menu "Map->Auto-Joining"
to enable it. Whenever you insert or delete a wall now, any walls of the same
type will automatically join to form a continuous solid wall.
This saves you the hassle of switching between all the different wall-arches.<br>
If using any arch set other than the standard one, you might need to customize
the file "autojoin.txt" in order to have the autojoining feature work for
all the available wall-styles.<br>
