<H1 align=center>Loading Arches and Maps</H1>

<P>First off: What are Daimonin Arches? - They are the definitions of
default objects, for example and ordinary orc, a door or standard food.
These arches are vital for the editor and you can't work without them.
</P>
<P>It is very important to know that there are two ways to load the Arches:
<ol>
  <LI><P>Load it from collected archive files. These should already be included
      in your editor and per default, these get loaded. Hence, if you don't
      want to care about arches, there's no need to worry about that.</P>
  <LI>Download the Daimonin arch package. You can download
      it either directly from CVS (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/daimonin/)
      or choose one of the download sites from http://daimonin.real-time.com/.<br>
      Once you've got the arch folder, you must <B>set the path</B> to this folder.
      Select the menu "File-&gt;Options...", uncheck the box "Load Arches from Collection",
      then enter the path in the arch-entry. When you're at it, you can also customize
      the default map-path. <br>
      Now you're ready to go. Click OK, quit the editor and restart it.
      This time the arches will load from all the individual arch and image files.
      You will notice that the editor takes about three times longer to load that way.
</ol>
<P>You might ask yourself now: "Why should I spend my time downloading the arch package
only to find out it takes three times longer to load?".
Well, at some point during mapmaking you will probably want to modify an arch,
create new arches or new images. And for that task, you need to have the individual
arche files in extracted form. However, don't worry too much about the loading time.
You can collect the arches after modifying/adding what you want (see menu:
"Resources-&gt;Collect CF Arches"). This will create new collected archives so you
can both have your changes and load in short time.
</P><br>
<P>Concerning maps: You don't neccessarily need to have the Daimonin maps.
You can just head off creating your own maps. Though, most likely you will
notice that Daimonin mapmaking isn't all that easy, and you'll want
to have working examples to look at. Besides, you will want to link your
maps into the existing Daimonin world and probably you'll want to test them too.
For all of that you need the Daimonin map package.
</P>
<P>Like the arches, you can get the maps either directly from CVS
(see http://sourceforge.net/projects/daimonin/) or choose one of the
download sites from http://daimonin.real-time.com/.
Don't forget to set the default map path to your local map directory
(menu "File-&gt;Options...").
</P><br>
<P> Note that there is a special convenience option for browsing through maps:
The "<B>enter exit</B>"-feature. You will probably know that in the Daimonin
game, maps are linked to each other via so-called exits
(doors, teleporters, buildings etc). You can select any such exit on
a map (left click on it), then activate the menu "Map-&gt;Enter Exit"
(or just hit &ltStrg&gt + &ltE&gt) and the map that this exit is pointing to gets loaded.<br>
