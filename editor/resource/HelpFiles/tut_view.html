<H1 align=center>The View Settings</H1>

<P>
Under the View-menu, you'll find three types of view settings:
<ol>
  <LI>the layout settings
  <LI>an option to change font
  <LI>the map settings
</ol>
</P>

<P>
With the <B>layout setting</B> (Metal/CDE/Windows) you can change the overall
look and feel of the editor. Personally I prefer the Metal-style, but
I'm not sure if anyone cares... :-p
</P>
<P>The <B>change font</B> panel allows you to adjust the font size and -style
applying for the entire editor. (Note that some stuff, like the HTML help pages or
window sizes are really hard to adjust. Therefore these obey mainly two font sizes:
less or equal 12 pt and greater than 12 pt.) Which fonts look good varies greatly
from system to system. The default font usually isn't the worst choice.
</P>
<P>The <B>map view settings</B> are a nifty feature that allows you to select
which types of objects you want to see & modify. For instance, if
you select "Show Monsters" and "Show Walls", the map view will display
only that: monsters and walls. Even copy/paste actions will ignore all
objects which do not match the active view settings.<br>
This feature can be used to detect disguised exits, connected objects
and more. You can also use it, for example, to copy objects without their
background tiles.
</P>

<P>
Unfortunately, the map view settings require pretty extensive calculations
when applied for the first time. So, if you have several large maps opened,
expect to wait a short moment after applying a new view setting.
