<H3>What are Treasurelists?</H3>
<P>Whenever a monster is generated or loaded in the world of Daimonin,
items are placed in it's inventory according to the monster's
treasurelist.<br>
Hence, treasurelists define what items get dropped when the monster
is killed. Even more importantly, they define which skills and spells the
monster has at it's disposal.</P>
<P>
You can view the treasurelists by selecting menu "Resources-&gt;View Treasurelists",
or from the <A HREF="tut_objects.html">attribute dialog</A>.
