<H1 align=center>Treasurelists producing one item</H1>

<P>You can recognize this type of treasurelist by the icon: <IMG SRC="treasureone_list.png" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM">,
as well as the name ending with "[one]". Such a treasurelist produces always
exactly one item from the list. The objects on the list can have different chances set
(the %-values in brackets), which indicate that some items are more likely to
get chosen, and other less likely.
</P>
<P><b>Examples for treasurelists producing one item:</b>
<br></P>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td><IMG SRC="treasure1.jpg" WIDTH="219" HEIGHT="155" ALIGN="CENTER"></td>
<td><IMG SRC="treasure2.jpg" WIDTH="257" HEIGHT="87" ALIGN="CENTER"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<P>As you can see in the right hand side example, treasurelists may contain yet
other treasurelists. If chosen, such sub-lists get processed in recursive fashion.
You can view the contents of each sub-list by clicking on the expand-mark.
