<P><B>Icon Toolbar:</B><br>
Contains shortcuts for certain commands.
</P>

<P><B>Default-Archpanel:</B><br>
This panel contains all the available default arches. You can select from the
list and then eventually insert them into your map.
</P>

<P><B>Arch Info:</B><br>
This small window contains some basic info about the selected arch from the
default-archpanel. Personally I prefer to squeeze this to zero height, in
order to have more space for the default-archpanel itself.
</P>

<P><B>Map View:</B><br>
The Map View shows the currently open and active map. Here you can select,
insert and delete objects.
</P>

<P><B>Map-Archpanel:</B><br>
This panel contains a list of all objects on the currently active (/selected)
map square. Here you can select/insert/delete single objects, similar to how
it works in the map view. Additionally you can change the stacking order of
the objects by pressing the up/down arrows below the panel.
</P>

<P><B>Object Attribute Window:</B><br>
Here you have a small interface for the most basic attributes of the currently
selected object. You can change it's name, face and message-text.
Don't forget to click "Apply" to apply the new settings.
</P>

<P><B>Archtext Window:</B><br>
This window contains the arch-attributes of the currently selected object.
You should know what you're doing when modifying these.
See <A HREF="tut_objects.html">Manipulating Objects</A>.<br>
Again, don't forget to hit "Apply".
</P>

<P><B>Status Bar:</B><br>
On the left side, the status bar displays the map-coordinates of your mouse
pointer as you move it across the map view. On the right side, the current
memory usage is displayed.<br>
