<H1 align=center>Treasurelists producing multiple items</H1>

<P>You can recognize this type of treasurelist by the icon: <IMG SRC="treasure_list.png" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM">.
Such a treasurelist can produce muliple items from the list. Objects with no chance set
are always generated - Others are only generated when they succeed a random-roll
at the given chance.</P>
<P>
Look at the example below, the "giant" treasurelist:<br>
Club, throwing skill and boulders will always be generated.
Goldcoins have a chance of 65% to be generated, and there
is only a 10% chance that one item out of the giant_parts list
is generated.
Numbers like in "<b>80</b> goldcoin" indicate that if chance succeeds,
a stack of 1-80 goldcoins can appear.<br>

<P>
Note that chances of different items do not influence each other in any way.
However, the YES/NO option allows to set dependencies between items.
Look at the example below, the "goblin" treasurelist:<br>
There is a 10% chance for the bow to be generated. Now <b>if</b> the bow
is generated, automatically arrows are generated too.<br>
There is a 5% chance for the sword to be generated. If that fails, the
shortsword has a 10% chance to be generated. If that fails again, there
is a 15% chance for the dagger.
