<H1 align=center>Modifying the Map Properties</H1>

<P>
Every map has "global properties": Reset time settings, map text etc.
These can be viewed and modified by selecting menu "Map->Map Properties".
</P>

<P><B>Map Text</B>:
This textfield is meant to contain the map creator's name (, evtl. email),
and the date when the map was created or last modified. If you are planning
to publish your maps on the net or get them into the official Daimonin
distribution then <B>please write your name into that textfield for
every map you create</B>.
</P>

<P><B>Unique</B>:
If set, this entire map is unique. Exactly unique to what will depend on how
it is used (It could be a per player unique map, or maybe a common map that is
just permanent for all the players).
</P>

<P><B>Fixed Reset</B>:
If enabled, the map reset countdown will not start over when someone
enters/exits the map. Thus, once the map has been loaded, it will reset in
'Reset Timeout' seconds, no matter what access happen. This is very useful for
shops and towns which are constantly accessed, but should be reset periodically.
</P>

<P><B>Outdoor Map</B>:
This is a very important attribute. It must be set for all outdoor maps.
An outdoor map is a map which is not meant to have a "ceiling" of any kind.
If your map contains grass and trees or rocks and hills, it is most likely
an outdoor map and you should set this flag.
</P>

<P><B>Enter X, Y</B>:
These values represent the location where players get inserted if entering
through an exit that has no destination coordinates set.
These coordinates are also used to re-insert players after map reset
when "Fixed Login" is enabled.
</P>

<P><B>Reset Timeout</B>:
Stores the number of seconds that need to elapse before this map will be reset.
For instance, if set to 1800, the map expires after 30 minutes. If set to zero,
a default value is applied.
</P>

<P><B>Swap Time</B>:
This controls how many ticks must elapse after the map has not been used before
it gets swapped out. swapping out is different than reset, as a swapped out map
will get loaded back into memory if someone re-visits it before it is reset.
Zero means the server takes a certain default value. <br>
Don't modify this value unless you know exactly what you're doing.
</P>

<P><B>Difficulty</B>:
This value stores the map difficulty. If set to zero, the server code will try
to come up with a reasonable difficulty value.
</P>

<P><B>Darkness</B>:
Light/darnkess of the map (overall). A value of -1 is default and the server will
set this map to daylight (will be overruled by outdoor flag). A value of 0 means
"no light" - absolute darkness. 1 means a bit light, 2 a bit more. Good values
for dark caves are 2 or 3. 4 is a good "ambient" value.
</P>

<P><B>Paths for Map-Tiling</B>:
These entries determine what map is tiled in that direction.
Map tiling is a feature that lets multiple maps be connected, effectively
forming a much larger single map. This is most useful for the outdoor
world maps, where it is not practical to have one massive map, but
the old style tiling method.
</P>

<P><B>No Magic</B>:
Special flag for unique maps. Map will not be saved for player but reloaded from
original source. Example is the tutorial map.
</P>

<P><B>No Magic</B>:
Players cannot cast magic spells anywhere on the map. This works like
the entire map was tiled with "no magic" arches.
</P>

<P><B>No Prayers</B>:
Players cannot cast prayers anywhere on the map. This works like
the entire map was tiled with "unholy floor" arches.
</P>

<P><B>No Harmful Spells</B>:
If enabled, players can cast only self spells (both magic and prayers),
and spells which have no damaging, negative or global effects.
This means all kinds of attack spells are disabled, as well as
stuff like recall and dimension door.<br>
This flag should always be set for cities or taverns which are
meant to be safe and don't have monsters wandering around.
</P>

<P><B>No Summon</B>:
Players cannot use summoning spells or skills.
</P>

<P><B>Fixed Login</B>:
This flag is very special and important: Normally, when a player
logs in to the game, he gets inserted at the place where he left.
However, in many cases this is troublesome. Players can get
stuck and starve, or they could keep sitting in big treasurerooms.
Therefore, on maps with "Fixed Login", players always get inserted to
the "Enter X/Y" coordinates if they log in AND the map has been
reset since they last left.
</P>

<P><B>PvP Enabled</B>:
If set, players are able to harm and kill each other on this map.
</P>

<P>
There are three flags for special death modes.
(These flags are exclusive, you should never set more than one):
<UL>
<LI><B>Permanent Death</B>: When a player dies he stays dead. An indestructible
   corpse of his body remains on the ground though. When another character
   manages to reach this corpse and revive it, the dead player comes back to life.</LI>
<LI><B>Ultra Death</B>: This is like Permanent Death, with the small difference
  that corpses decay and dissapear after a certain amount of time. That means the
  time to revive a player is limited. If it doesn't happen in time, this unlucky
  player is deleted and there is no way to get him back to life EVER.</LI>
<LI><B>Instant Death</B>: The ultimate challenge - When a player dies on this
  map, he is instantly deleted. There is no chance whatsoever to be revived.</LI>
</UL>
