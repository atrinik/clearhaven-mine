<H1 align=center>(This is a quick-and-dirty documentation for the plugin interface 
  - expect a better one soon).</H1>
<p>List of supported events.<br>
  =========================</p>
<p>Local events<br>
  ------------<br>
  Those can be attached to a specific object in the game.</p>
<p>APPLY<br>
  Tag: event_apply<br>
  This event is generated whenever the object is applied or unapplied.</p>
<p>ATTACK<br>
  Tag: event_attack<br>
  This event is used in two cases:<br>
  - bound to a weapon, it is triggered each time the weapon is used to slay<br>
  something; this can typically be used to generate special effects when<br>
  you hit a monster;<br>
  - bound to a monster, it is triggered when the monster is attacked.</p>
<p>CLOSE<br>
  Tag: event_close<br>
  Generated when a container is closed.</p>
<p>DEATH<br>
  Tag: event_death<br>
  Generated when the object dies.</p>
<p>DROP<br>
  Tag: event_drop<br>
  Generated when the object is dropped, either on the floor or in a container.</p>
<p>PICKUP<br>
  Tag: event_pickup<br>
  Generated when the object is picked up.</p>
<p>SAY<br>
  Tag: event_say<br>
  Generated when someone says something around the object.</p>
<p>STOP<br>
  Tag: event_stop<br>
  Generated for a thrown object, when the object is stopped for some reason.</p>
<p>TIME<br>
  Tag: event_time<br>
  Generated each time the object gets an opportunity to move.</p>
<p>THROW<br>
  Tag: event_throw<br>
  Generated when the object is thrown.</p>
<p>TRIGGER<br>
  Tag: event_trigger<br>
  Used for various objects, like traps, teleporters or triggers. Generated when<br>
  those objects are used (for example, when a player passes through a teleporter)</p>
<p>Global events<br>
  -------------<br>
  Those concern the game as a whole or can't be bound to a specific object.<br>
  Those events may be &quot;registered&quot; by a plugin (it means that the plugin 
  requests<br>
  to get a message each time one of those events happens).</p>
<p>BORN<br>
  Generated when a new character is created.</p>
<p>CLOCK<br>
  Generated at each game loop.<br>
  Warning: When no player is logged, the loop &quot;stops&quot;, meaning that 
  clock events<br>
  are not generated anymore !</p>
<p>CRASH<br>
  Generated when a server crash does occur. It is not a recursive event, so if 
  a<br>
  crash occur from *inside* the crash event handling, it is not called a second<br>
  time, preventing infinite loops to occur.<br>
  Note: This event is not implemented for now.</p>
<p>GDEATH<br>
  Generated whenever someone dies.</p>
<p>GKILL<br>
  Generated whenever something/someone is killed.</p>
<p>LOGIN<br>
  Generated whenever a player logs into the game.</p>
<p>LOGOUT<br>
  Generated whenever a player logs out the game.</p>
<p>MAPENTER<br>
  Generated whenever someone enters a map.</p>
<p>MAPLEAVE<br>
  Generated whenever someone leaves a map.</p>
<p>MAPRESET<br>
  Generated each time a map is reset.</p>
<p>REMOVE<br>
  Generated when a player character is removed from the game (&quot;quit&quot; 
  command).</p>
<p>SHOUT<br>
  Generated whenever someone shouts something.</p>
<p>The case of Python<br>
  ==================</p>
<p>Here is how CFPython handles events:<br>
  - local events are managed using the event_... tags. The event_..._plugin tag<br>
  should be Python. the event_... specifies the name of the Python script to<br>
  run. This path is relative to the crossfire map subdirectory.</p>
<p>- global events are all registered by CFPython. If you want to react to one 
  of<br>
  them, you need to create script files in a python/ subdirectory of your<br>
  crossfire map directory. Those files should be called:<br>
  python_shout.py : for the shout global event;<br>
  python_mapenter.py : for the mapenter global event;<br>
  python_remove.py : for the remove global event;<br>
  and so on.<br>
  Some special values are also passed to CFPython for each global event. Those<br>
  are:<br>
  BORN : WhoIsActivator = The object representing the new character.<br>
  LOGIN: WhoAmI and WhoIsActivator = the object representing the character.<br>
  WhatIsMessage = The IP address of the player.<br>
  LOGOUT: Same as for LOGIN.<br>
  REMOVE: WhoIsActivator = The object representing the deleted char.<br>
  SHOUT: WhoIsActivator = The object that shouted something.<br>
  WhatIsMessage = The message shout.<br>
  MAPENTER: WhoIsActivator = The object that entered the new map.<br>
  MAPLEAVE: WhoIsActivator = The object that is leaving the map.<br>
  MAPRESET: WhatIsMessage = The path name of the map reset.<br>
