There are two kinds of "EXITS". Some exits like magic

The other class of  EXITS are objects like stairs,

To enter this kind of exits you have to 'a'pply them

THE APPLY COMMAND
As shown before, the apply command will 'use' an
object. Food is eaten, levers are pulled and weapons
wielded.
Remember that some items can't be applied. You
will get a message normally but sometimes not.
Some items must be picked up first - they can't be
applied when they are on the floor. Other items
will act differently when applied on the floor. You will
get a message then explaining what's going on.

To DROP items from your inventory to below you

OBJECT STACKS
If there are mutiple objects of the same kind, they can build STACKS. Not all objects can build stacks.
Coins for example can build stacks. There is a stack of 4 copper coins in front of this sign. Get them with the 'g'et command. You will then be asked in a small window how many of the 4 coins you want to get. Pressing return or 'g' again will get all. You can also enter a number getting only a part of the stack. Items not picked up will stay on the floor.

WEAPONS
You can't take the weapons there on the floor, they
are only examples. But you will find this and *a lot* more
weapons of every imaginable kind later in the game.
Note: Impact & slash weapons are most common
in the game. Pierce weapons are more exotic and
you will not find that many in the game but because
most protection focus more on impact, slash and cleave,
they will become more dangerous at higher levels.
Cleave weapons (for example axes) are also dangerous.

THIS TUTORIAL IS NOT RPGish
What does that mean?
It means that in this tutorial we speak to the person
behind the screen. To you, the computer user and
not to the character you have created.
Why? Atrinik is a complex system and we have
players very new to this kind of game.
We need to help them as much as possible.
Note: This tutorial is the one and only place in the
game communicating with the player only.

name Scrolling Messages

SCROLLING IN THE MESSAGE WINDOW
Sometimes messages are too long to fit the window, or maybe you just want to look back and see what was said five minutes ago.
You can use the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys to view older messages. You can also control the scroll bar with your mouse.
Note that it is easy to miss new messages if you aren't at the bottom of the message window!

OTHER INVENTORY COMMANDS
There are some more commands for objects.
With 'm' for MARK, you can mark an object. Some
NPCs might want a marked object when
they do an action. They will tell you about it then.
With 'l' for LOCK you can lock a item in your
inventory. You cannot drop a locked item unless you

MORE TALKING
There are some chat commands in the game:
/shout <message> sends a message to all players.
/tell <player name> <message> only one player
/say <message> only in the visible area
/say is default chat command - if you type
something in the console it will be handled
as "said" when it doesn't start with a '/',
The '/' is reserved for marking commands.

@match roger
You have said "roger" to me.
Many people in the game have hidden keywords
which you must find out. Sometimes you have
to listen carefully, other times you have to read
a hint somewhere else. Well, read the last signs
now and then talk to the gatekeeper in the next
room. Good luck.
@match *
Hello Stranger!
You can talk to me by pressing the RETURN key
again. Type ^roger^ and I will give you some hints
releated to chatting. I will repeat this text every time
you ask me something different. So type ^roger^ now.
You can also click on the blue roger text using
your mouse. Read the sign in the edge there
to learn more about mouse & chatting.

TALKING USING THE MOUSE
You can talk to NPCs using the mouse only: Click on an NPC with the right mouse button to target him.
A bit right of the target name you will see a "hello" button. Click on it with the left mouse button.
This will make you say "hello" to the NPC. You can then click with the left mouse button on any blue keywords in the text window to say it out loud.
This doesn't work when chatting with players - only with NPCs.

CORPSES
Corpses appear when you have killed an enemy.
They are used like CONTAINERS and will hold the
"loot" - all the items your enemy carried when killed.
Open this corpse like a container and 'g'et these items.
Note the "(bounty of YOU)" in the name of the corpse.
If there is your name, ONLY you can access the
container - no one else. People will not be able to
steal your loot from your kills.

FOG OF WAR
Some objects like walls and solid doors will block
your "line of sight" (LOS). You can't see what's
behind them. But for some time you will remember
the structure of an area where you have recently been.
That area is shown in a dark blue color.
Note that your memory will vanish for areas you

msg
HIT POINTS AND LEVELS
Every creature has an amount of hit points (short: HP).
If the hit points drop to zero, the creature or
player will die. The green line inside the target marker
shows the current hit points of that creature in %.
A full line means 100% hp, half a line 50%. If you target
the 2 ants you will see that the black one is nearly dead
and the red has only 70% left. Same mobs can have
different level and hp! Always look for the target color,
or the level 75 ant with 10000 hp will ruin your day.

RANGE SYSTEM & THROWING
Atrinik has a complex range system allowing you to throw items, fire bows or spells but also using skills!
By using the TAB key you can cycle through the range actions. You can have different range actions prepared but you only can use *one* at time.
To throw/fire/control something you press and hold the CONTROL (CTRL) key and choose a direction with your movement keys. The object or spell will be fired in that direction!
If you have a target and you press CONTROL (CTRL) key and 5 on numpad, your character will attempt to fire in the direction of the target.

MONSTERS & TARGETING
Here you see some of your enemies. They are called monsters or mobs. Don't fear, they are frozen.
You can target the mobs by pressing the '^X^' key!
Pressing the 'x' key several times will loop through all visible targets. A green marker above the head of the mob will mark your current target. Press '^x^' now!
After you target something it's name is shown on the left side of the screen. The color of the name has a special meaning - read about it on the next sign.

THE CON COLOR SYSTEM
Con'ing (short: 'con') means considering wether you are
able to be victorious over your target when you fight it.
The color of your target's name in the target area will
show you the general chances of it.
There are 7 colors starting from "too low to get xp"
to "too strong to kill even in your dreams!".
Remember: its only a CONSIDER. Some monsters
have special powers and that is NOT considered.
You'll find an overview on the next sign.

HOW TO FIGHT
As you can see, you have now a weapon in your hand. To fight with it you need 2 things: 1) a target and 2)  to be in combat mode.
Target with the 'x' key as before, and change from SAFE to COMBAT mode with the 'c' key.
When you press 'c' the shield symbol in front of the target name area will change to two crossed swords. Pressing 'c' again will change back to SAFE. You don't have to press 'c' before every attack.

If you open your inventory you will see the armour you got from the start. There are various kinds of armour: body armours, helmets and more. Most of them give you PROTECTION against one or more ATTACK TYPE - for example slash or cleave.
If you apply the armour a message will say how much it protects - you can also see your current protection status in the armour protection table. The values tell how many percent of a hit your armour will absorb.

PRAYING
Every prayer needs grace for casting.
Every time you cast a prayer, you will lose some of that grace.
Without enough grace you can't cast a prayer.
To recover grace you have to PRAY.
Hit the 'p' key for 'p'raying.  You will pray until you
reach your maximum grace. Be warned: You will
stop fighting when you start praying - and moving,
damage or other action will break praying!

THROWING
Let's test the range system and throw these daggers.
Start by picking them up, then press SHIFT to open your inventory and move the blue selection box over them.
Now press 'f' for 'f'ire on the daggers! That will put them in the range selection under throwing. Now press TAB until you can see them in the range selection.
You are ready! Hold control pressed and use your movement keys to fire them around! They will fall down if they hit a wall - go and get them again.

msg
ATTACK THE COMBAT DUMMY
Now attack this combat dummy. Do not fear, it's only a training golem. It will not fight back or die.
Press the 'x' key to target the golem and 'c' to get into combat mode. Move next to the golem and watch the hit messages and the hit numbers over your target's head.
Try to play around with 'x' and 'c' key - this is an easy fight but most times you have *a lot* more action.
Exit through the door when you are done testing.

It is not very dark here. Dark caves and dark
nights are much darker! Never go out without
a light source. A lamp or a magic lamp will give
more light than a torch. Also, magic powers like
x-rays or infravision will enhance your vision.

PRAYER & DEITIES
To cast heal spells and other prayers you need contact with a holy force - a higher being called a 'deity' or a powerful artifact like the Tabernacle.
Prayers are spells using GRACE. That's a special power needed to cast prayers. You get grace by praying to your deity - in the case of the Tabernacle praying is a special form of meditation.
Talk to the priest over there. He will answer when you say "hello". He will also teach you your first prayer!

CONTAINERS
Containers can be used to store other objects inside.
You can only have *one* open container at any time - if you open another, the first one will close automatically.
To open a container like this chest, move to it and 'a'pply it! It will open and you will see all items inside. Select the item you want and 'g'et it with 'g' key. To put an item inside, just 'd'rop it.
The shelf and locker on the wall are also containers, and you will find many more in the game.

LIGHT SOURCES AND DARKNESS
Some areas are darker than others. Outdoors you might be surprised by nightfall, and some caves can be completely dark.
To have a light, get this torch. Apply the torch TWO (2) times! The first apply will light the torch. The light is hidden until the second apply which will put the torch in your hand. You will see it appear on your player doll.
Open the door if your torch is ready - it's dark on the other side.

CONTAINER FOR YOUR INVENTORY
Some containers like this sack can be picked up and carried in your inventory, but their usage is different: To open the container, you must apply it two(!) times!
The first apply will READY it. If you now pick up an item, the item will be automatically stored in your readied container!
That's very useful to collect arrows in a quiver, for example. A 2nd apply will open the container and let you move things in and out of it with the 'g' key.

END OF TUTORIAL
Now it is time to enter the world of Atrinik!
There is A LOT more to learn: casting spells, fighting, using bows, two-handed weapons, scrolls, potions... well, you have to encounter a whole world!
The purple portal behind this gate there will teleport you to the mercenary guild in Stoneglow. Just step into the portal and you are on the way.
When you have reached the other side, speak to the guild master. Bye.
