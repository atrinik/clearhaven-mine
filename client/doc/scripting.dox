@section page_scripting_intro Introduction

Since a program can't possibly have every single feature users want,
scripting is used, which provides additional features.

@section page_scripting_how_works How it works

The script is a program which is external to the client. It can be
written in a wide range of languages, including C, Java, Perl, Python,
Bash, PHP, anything you can think about. How can this be possible? Let's
take a look at what happens when you type "echo hello world" on a shell
prompt. Sure it writes on your terminal "hello world". And if you are in
a graphical shell prompt? It appears in the graphical console! Some
process changed your request of writing to screen to a complex process of
getting system's font and rendering the line in the specified window at
the specified position. All this is because when you ask to "write hello
world to screen" you really ask to "write hello world to the standard
output device". This standard output device is called stdout. There is
also the stdin, which most of the time is your keyboard and stderr, the
standard error device being most of the time the same as stdout.


Now what Atrinik client uses is exactly the same trick as the graphical
console. When the client runs a script, it changes the script's stdin
and replaces the keyboard input with it's own orders (using a pipe). And
it changes the stdout so instead of writing to screen, the script sends
data to the client (using another pipe). And this is how any language
can be used. Because every language can write to the screen and read from
the keyboard!

@section page_scripting_examples Examples

Consider the following example:

@code
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf("issue command /say Hello World.\n");
	fflush(stdout);
	return 0;
}
@endcode

The above example would, when compiled and executed by the client, use
the /say command to output the message "Hello World." to everyone in
hearing range.

Another example is this:

@code
#include <stdio.h>

static char *directions[] = {
	"s", "w",
	"n", "e"
};

#define NUM_DIRECTIONS (int) (sizeof(directions) / sizeof(char *))

#define NUM_REPEATS 4

int main()
{
	int i, ii;

	for (i = 0; i <= NUM_REPEATS; i++)
	{
		for (ii = 0; ii < NUM_DIRECTIONS; ii++)
		{
			printf("issue command /%s\n", directions[ii]);
			fflush(stdout);
		}
	}

	return 0;
}
@endcode

The above example would make your character go south, west, north and
east, repeating the process 4 times.

@section page_scripting_flushing_stdout Flushing stdout

The stdout has something called a buffer. When you write to output
device, it's not immediately sent to it. For performance reasons,
successive prints to stdout are grouped. Most of the time, \\n is enough
to force sending of data, but we ensure all the data is sent to client by
flushing the stdout (force empty buffer). In the future, when you think
client didn't get a command but the script did send it, ensure you
flushed stdout.

@section page_scripting_commands Commands

This section documents all the possible commands a script can use to make
the client do something.

 - <b>draw</b> \<color\> \<message\>: Draw a message to player's client.
 - <b>log</b> \<log_level\> \<message\>: Log a message using log_level level.
 - <b>request</b> \<type\>: Request an information from client's memory.
   - <b>player</b>: Return player's tag, rank, rank and name, pname, race,
     title, alignment, gender and godname.
   - <b>weight</b>: Return player's weight limit, weight and carrying.
   - <b>stat stats</b>: Return Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Pow and Cha stats.
   - <b>stat combat</b>: Return wc, ac, damage, speed and weapon speed.
   - <b>stat hp</b>: Return hp, maxhp, sp, maxsp, grace, maxgrace and food.
   - <b>stat exp</b>: Return player's level, overall experience, and all
   - skill categories with their level and experience.
   - <b>stat protections</b>: Return player's protections table.
   - <b>items inv</b>: Return all items from player's inventory, line by line.
   - <b>items applied</b>: Returns all applied items from player's inventory.
   - <b>items below</b>: Return items from player's below inventory window.
 - <b>issue command \<command\></b>: Issue a command. This includes parsing client-side commands.
 - <b>issue string \<string\></b>: Send a string directly to the server. Useful for things like
   "ap tag-id" to apply an item with tag ID of tag-id.
 - <b>event register \<event name\></b>: Register an event.
 - <b>event unregister \<event name\></b>: Unregister an event.

@section page_scripting_events Events

When something happens, events can be triggered. For example, when server
sends stats update, the @ref SCRIPT_EVENT_STATS "stats event" is
triggered. This can be useful for scripts watching food and eat something
when it reaches critical point, or if hp goes way too down and there is
grace to be spared cast a healing spell or find a potion of healing in
inventory and apply it.
