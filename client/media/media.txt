Beside the official Atrinik media packages,
user can change the media files or create new packages.

Please note:
User defined media packages are NOT part of the Atrinik system
and/or the license. They are NOT available from the official Atrinik
host.

If an user changes the content of the media directory, all copyright or law
issues are part of HIS action.

All references to the files inside the media directory are neutral tags.
Nor the system or a server has any knowledge about the content of the media
directory.

User has to change by hand the file names and install and copy then to the 
media directory. Please be sure you don't hurt any copyright law in this action.

** It is forbidden to copy, trade or offer Atrinik client packages with user
   modified media directory. This action will be against the GNU Open Source licence
   and any other copyright issue **

Selfmade media packages must come without ANY official Atrinik file.
