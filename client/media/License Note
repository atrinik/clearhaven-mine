Atrinik Media License
----------------------

Disclaimer

The Atrinik Media License is the Artistic License, which can be found
in the Atrinik main directory.

Because the Atrinik/client/media directory can be user extended, the Atrinik
Artistic License is ONLY VALID FOR MEDIA FILES WHICH ARE PART OF THE ATRINIK
OPEN SOURCE PROJECT.

This includes ONLY files which are part of the Atrinik SVN tree.

If a file in this directory is NOT part of the Atrinik SVN tree, it is NOT an official
Atrinik media file. In this case a 3rd party (user) has altered the content
of the media directory and/or the whole Atrinik package.

The common alteration of the media directory comes with "media extension packages" 
for the Atrinik project. This kind of packages are not official project parts
and/or submited by users or a different 3rd party.

It IS allowed to change, delete or extend the media directory for personal use.

It is NOT allowed to make this altered package public as part of the Atrinik 
project - it is only allowed to make it puplic as an "user media extension package
for Atrinik".

This kind of package must be declared as Atrinik media extension. It is not allowed
to trade any original Atrinik project file inside this package, except license or
documentation files.

A copyright note inside that package must explain this explicit to avoid any confusion.

A file inside the media directory will NEVER be sent or even altered to or from the
server - a server or 3rd party has no direct access to the media directory. The only way
to change files inside the media directory is for user to install them.

Remember that you have to control the right use of copyrights when you use 3rd
party files for this directory.

You can control the official Atrinik files by browsing the Atrinik SVN file
list which can be found on the Atrinik project page.

Personal note: 
I had written this file to avoid any copyright problems with 3rd partys who think they 
can/should trade unofficial files in the media directory as part of Atrinik. It is not
to harm any 3rd party extension.
