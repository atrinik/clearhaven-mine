		others. To achieve this, set the &lt;importance&gt; to a value
		greater than one. Abilities with this value zero/unset are
		counted to be of &lt;importance&gt; one.

		Example: A monster with "firestorm" of &lt;importance&gt; 3 and
		"magic bullet" of &lt;importance&gt; 1 will averagely cast three
		out of four times the "firestorm".</td>
