		</td><td>    Every item has a natural material quality, ranging from 0 top 100.
    This is a % factor, which affects the base stats of the item.
    However, &lt;max. quality&gt; does not represent the actual state of the
    item but the best &lt;actual quality&gt; value this item can ever have.

    Basic quality is 80%. If the item is made of cheap material, the
    value may be lower. If made of very fine material it may be 100%.</td>
