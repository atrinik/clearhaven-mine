		</td><td>		When an active object (with 'speed' being non-zero) is put on a
		map, this value is used as counter. Every 'tick', 'speed' (if
		negative, value is turned positive before) is added to this
		value - if it is bigger than 0 the object 'will do something' and
		this counter is decreased with -1.0.

		By default a normal object will be put on the map with start
		speed 0. It 'will do something' with the next coming 'tick'.
		Setting this value to -1.0 will put it on map but wait one full
		'lifetime' round until it does something.

		A 'fire object' should be put on map with start speed 0 - it
		should try to burn something in the moment it comes in the game.
		A bomb for example should be put with speed -1.0 on the map - it
		will stay then on map until the bomb becomes active - it
		explodes.

		The 'lifetime' round is determinated by speed. A speed of 1.0
		will give a 'lifetime' round of 1 tick - a speed of 0.01 100
		ticks.

		Special case: A negative speed value will add to start speed a
		random value between 0.0 to 0.9 . So, a speed of -0.1 with a
		start speed of -1.0 will result in speed 0.1 and start speed
		between -1.0 and -0.1. This is useful to let a row of same
		objects act in different tick ranges.</td>

		</td><td>		This value sets the speed of the DOT ticks. Careful - a value of
