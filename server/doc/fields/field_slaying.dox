		</td><td>		This string specifies the item that must be put on the altar to
		activate it. It can either be the name of an archetype, or
		directly the name of an object. Yet, titles are not recognized by
		altars. Remember to put a note somewhere, telling the player what
		he is expected to drop on the altar. Often this is put in the
		altar's name: E.g. "drop 100 platinums".</td>

		put on the converter, as payment.</td>
	</tr>

		<td>
@ref page_type_42
		</td><td>		The created object will bear the name specified in
		&lt;name creation&gt;. If nothing is set, the standard name of
		the archetype is used.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
@ref page_type_51
		</td><td>		&lt;Match name&gt; specifies the name of the object we are
		looking for. Actually it does also check for the
		&lt;key string&gt; in key-objects, but for this case inventory
		checkers are often more powerful to use.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
@ref page_type_66, @ref page_type_94, @ref page_type_41, @ref page_type_95
		</td><td>		The exit path defines the map that the player is transferred to.

		You can enter an absolute path, beginning with '/' (for example
		"/tutorial"). It can also be a relative path, not beginning with
		'/' (on the map "/shattered_islands/world_0303" for example I
		could use the relative path "0304"). Use relative paths whenever
		possible! Note that upper/lower case must always be set
		correctly. However, please use lower case only.

		It is well possible to have an exit pointing to the same map that
		the exit is on. If slaying is not set in an exit, the player will
		see a message like "The exit is closed".</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
@ref page_type_64
		</td><td>		This string specifies the object we are looking for: We have a
		match if the player does/don't carry a key object or a mark with
		identical &lt;key string&gt;. This string is compared to the name
		of an object. If the "match = slaying field" is set, the text is
		compared to the slaying field of the object we search for. This
		can make sense if we really want avoid any problems with user set
		names of objects.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
@ref page_type_20
		</td><td>		The &lt;key string&gt; in the door must be identical with the
		&lt;key string&gt; in the special key, then the door is unlocked.
		It is VERY important to set the &lt;key string&gt; to something that
		is unique among the Atrinik maps.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
@ref page_type_55
		</td><td>		The &lt;key string&gt; can be detected by inventory checkers/
		detectors. If the player already has a force with that
		&lt;key string&gt;, there won't be inserted a second one.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
@ref page_type_17, @ref page_type_32
		</td><td>		The &lt;match race&gt; defines the object we're looking for. If
		&lt;match race&gt; matches the monster's or the player's race, we
		have a match. Yes, pedestals can detect a player's race! E.g. you
		could create a place where only fireborns can enter, by setting
		"slaying unnatural".

		If it is set to "player", any player stepping on the pedestal is
		a match. Very useful if you want to open a gate for players but
		not for monsters.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
@ref page_type_13
		</td><td>		Slaying means the weapon does triple (3x) damage to monsters of
		the specified race. If &lt;slaying race&gt; matches an arch name,
		only monsters of that archetype receive triple damage.

		Triple damage is very effective, especially on higher levels.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
@ref page_type_154

			but if present, overrides the &lt;spell&gt; setting.</td>

@ref page_type_21
		</td><td>		This string must be identical with the &lt;key string&gt; in the
		locked door, then it can be unlocked. It can also be used to
		trigger inventory checkers.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
@ref page_type_85
		</td><td>		This string also defines the contained spell (just like field
		above), but here you write the spell's name directly.
		Setting both &lt;spell&gt; and &lt;spell name&gt; makes no sense.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
@ref page_type_15
		</td><td>		Slaying means the weapon does triple (3x) damage to monsters of

@ref page_type_119
		</td><td>		Path to destination map. Leave blank to use current map.

		You can enter an absolute path, beginning with '/' (for example
