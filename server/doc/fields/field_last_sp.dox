		appears lit up on dark maps. The higher the value, the more light
		does the object emit. The current reasonable max value is 9.

		If the value is 0, the light can't be lit and can't be applied.
		This is used for burned out lights like torches.

		If the value is negative, this object will invoke darkness.</td>

		should cast a healing spell on the player, this must be direction
		0. For other spells like firestorm, it should be set a valid
		point of the compass direction.</td>

		</td><td>		If this attribute is enabled, the altar trigger won't push the
		connected value by altar reset. Only ONCE by dropping the
		sacrifice. This is typically used when the altar is connected to
		a creator, e.g. for selling tickets.

		If this attribute is disabled (default), the altar trigger will
		push the connected value TWICE per sacrifice: First by dropping
		sacrifice, second by reset. This mode is typically used for
		altars being connected to gates, resulting in the gate being
		opened and closed again.</td>
