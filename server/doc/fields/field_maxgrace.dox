		</td><td>    The disease will last in the host for &lt;curing duration&gt; "disease moves"
    (Assuming the host survives and doesn't use a curing spell).
    After this period the disease is naturally cured, which provides the
    host with immunity from this particular disease of lower or equal level.

    A negative value means the disease can never be cured naturally.

    Note that this value can be further modulated by spell-parameters,
    if the disease is registered as spell in the code. Due to that,
    most default diseases take a lot longer to cure than it seems.</td>
