		</td><td>		&lt;Remove match&gt; means remove object if found. Setting this
		is usually not recommended because inventory checkers are in
		general invisible. So, unlike for altars/locked doors, the player
		won't expect to lose an object when walking over that square. And
		he doesn't even get a message either.

		So, *if* you enable &lt;remove match&gt;, make sure to inform the
		player what's going on!</td>

		point itself is. Increasing the value will start a search around
		the spot, starting in the south. value 2 searches spot 0, -1,
		value 3 spot 1, -1, 4 = 0, -1, etc.</td>
