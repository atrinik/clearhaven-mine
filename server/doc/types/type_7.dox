@section Description
	<![CDATA[
		When eating, the player's stomach is drained by 1/4 of food and
		the player is poisoned (a DOT poisoned force is inserted in the
		player). Until the DOT (DOT = Damage Over Time) force wears out,
		the player gets damage all x ticks.

		Also stats and resists can be affected.

		two-handed, polearms and so on. This value goes to the client
		too.

		Warning: Not all objects have a sub type and changing it without
		care can corrupt server AND/OR the clients. Normally this is not
		a subject to change outside arch definition.
