		invisible and hidden from the players.

		System objects are put in layer 0.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>invisible</td>
		<td>@ref FLAG_IS_INVISIBLE</td>
		<td>		Generally makes the object invisible. Invisible objects will be

		objects totally from detection, use "sys_object".
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>is animated</td>
		<td>@ref FLAG_ANIMATE</td>
		<td>		If set, the object is animated and animation is used.

		Note: Some special objects will use an animation NOT as animation
		but as frame list. Examples are buttons (which frames are changed
		by the object status of the button). IS_TURNABLE will enable
		direction turning for some object types. These flags are all
		system related. Be VERY careful when changing them.

		<td>@ref obj::layer</td>
		<td>		This is the map layer the object will put in. The selected layer
		will affect where and how this object is shown on client side.
		Layer 0 is reserved for sys_object type objects and will NEVER be
		shown on client side. Layer 1 is for floor objects and layer 2
		for floor masks. Layer 3 and 4 are for items on the ground. Layer
		5 is for walls, layer 6 is reserved for players and layer 7 is
		for spell effects and high flying/visible objects like arrows.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>literacy level</td>
		<td>@ref obj::level</td>
		<td>		If this value is set to be greater than zero, the player needs a
		certain literacy level to succeed reading the book. The book can
		be read if: mental level is greater than &lt;literacy level&gt; -
		5. Adding level to a book can be a nice idea, personally I like
		it when a player needs more than his fighting skills to solve a
		quest. However, keep the book's level at least below 15 because
		it is quite difficult to gain high mental levels.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>magical</td>
		<td>@ref FLAG_IS_MAGICAL</td>
		<td>		If set, this object counts as "magical". Detect magic or identify
		will show this flag and the player will see a small blue M in the
		client's inventory part.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>material</td>
		<td>@ref obj::material_real</td>
		<td>		The material defines the exact material of which the object
		consists. It is much more specific than &lt;material class&gt;,
		however only one material can be selected, not multiple.

		&lt;material&gt; is not required to be set, it can be left
		'undefined'.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>material class</td>
		<td>@ref obj::material</td>
		<td>		This bitmask-value informs the player of which basic material(s)
		the object consists. Material class does also affect how likely
		the object can be destroyed by hazardous spell-effects, like
		firestorm.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>name</td>
		<td>@ref obj::name</td>
		<td>		This is the name of the object, displayed to the player.

		<td>@ref FLAG_NO_MAGIC</td>
		<td>		If enabled, it is impossible for players to use spells on that
		spot.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>no teleport</td>
		<td>@ref FLAG_NO_TELEPORT</td>
		<td>		Marks an object as no teleport object. A no teleport object can't
		be teleported by teleporter except if the object is inside the
		inventory of another object which can be teleported.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>non-pickable</td>
		<td>@ref FLAG_NO_PICK</td>
		<td>		If set, the object cannot be picked up (neither by players nor
		monsters).
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>number</td>
		<td>@ref obj::nrof</td>
		<td>		This value determines the number of objects in one stack (for
		example: 100 goldcoins =&gt; "number = 100"). You should set this
		at least to one, for any pickable object - otherwise it won't be
		mergeable into a stack.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>one drop</td>
		<td>@ref FLAG_ONE_DROP</td>
		<td>		In the moment a player gets or applies this item, it will be
		flagged as godgiven and vanish when dropped to the ground.

		If this flag is set for an item inside monster's quest_container
		with the quest being quest item type, the player will be able to
		find the item again, should he lose it.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>permanent cursed</td>
		<td>@ref FLAG_PERM_CURSED</td>
		<td>		The item is permanently cursed. If this flag is set, applying or
		unapplying it will set "cursed 1" again. This flag can't be
		removed by remove curse.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>permanent damned</td>
		<td>@ref FLAG_PERM_DAMNED</td>
		<td>		The item is permanently damned. If this flag is set, applying or
		unapplying it will set "damned 1" again. This flag can't be
		removed by remove damnation.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>player only</td>
		<td>@ref FLAG_PLAYER_ONLY</td>
		<td>		If set, only players can enter the tile the object with this flag
		is on.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>start speed</td>
		<td>@ref obj::speed_left</td>
		<td>		When an active object (with 'speed' being non-zero) is put on a
		map, this value is used as counter. Every 'tick', 'speed' (if
		negative, value is turned positive before) is added to this
		value - if it is bigger than 0 the object 'will do something' and
		this counter is decreased with -1.0.

		By default a normal object will be put on the map with start
		speed 0. It 'will do something' with the next coming 'tick'.
		Setting this value to -1.0 will put it on map but wait one full
		'lifetime' round until it does something.

		A 'fire object' should be put on map with start speed 0 - it
		should try to burn something in the moment it comes in the game.
		A bomb for example should be put with speed -1.0 on the map - it
		will stay then on map until the bomb becomes active - it
		explodes.

		The 'lifetime' round is determinated by speed. A speed of 1.0
		will give a 'lifetime' round of 1 tick - a speed of 0.01 100
		ticks.

		Special case: A negative speed value will add to start speed a
		random value between 0.0 to 0.9 . So, a speed of -0.1 with a
		start speed of -1.0 will result in speed 0.1 and start speed
		between -1.0 and -0.1. This is useful to let a row of same
		objects act in different tick ranges.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>sub type</td>
		<td>@ref obj::sub_type1</td>
		<td>		This important value is used to define "sub types" for objects of
		the same object type. Examples are weapons, which are all from
		type WEAPON but can be different sub types like slash, cleave,
		two-handed, polearms and so on. This value goes to the client
		too.

		Warning: Not all objects have a sub type and changing it without
		care can corrupt server AND/OR the clients. Normally this is not
		a subject to change outside arch definition.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>title</td>
		<td>@ref obj::title</td>
		<td>		This is the object's title. Once an object is identified the
		title is attached to the name. Typical titles are "of Yordan",
		"of xray vision" etc.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>unique item</td>
		<td>@ref FLAG_UNIQUE</td>
		<td>		Unique items exist only one time on a server. If the item is
		taken, lost or destroyed - it's gone for good.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>unpaid</td>
		<td>@ref FLAG_UNPAID</td>
		<td>		An &lt;unpaid&gt; item cannot be used unless the player carried
		it over a shop mat, paying the demanded price. Setting this flag
		makes sense only for items inside shops.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>value</td>
		<td>@ref obj::value</td>
		<td>		Change an object's value.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>weight</td>
		<td>@ref obj::weight</td>
		<td>		This value defines the object's weight in gram (1000g is 1kg).
		Objects with zero weight are not pickable for players. Still, set
		the "non-pickable" flag for explicitly non-pickable objects.
		</td>
