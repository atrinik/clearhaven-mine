/**
@page page_type_119 Waypoint Object


@section Description
		The waypoint object can hold a position that a monster is to
		reach.

		Mobs will only use waypoints if their attack_movement attribute
		is between 176 and 191.

		When the mob reaches the destination, it will either continue to
		the next waypoint, or stop. Waypoints can be used to set up
		patrol routes or make more dynamic script behaviours.

		When a waypoint is reached, a TRIGGER event will be executed.

		Missiles are designed to be used as stacks for example.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>start speed</td>
		<td>@ref obj::speed_left</td>
		<td>		When an active object (with 'speed' being non-zero) is put on a
		map, this value is used as counter. Every 'tick', 'speed' (if
		negative, value is turned positive before) is added to this
		value - if it is bigger than 0 the object 'will do something' and
		this counter is decreased with -1.0.

		By default a normal object will be put on the map with start
		speed 0. It 'will do something' with the next coming 'tick'.
		Setting this value to -1.0 will put it on map but wait one full
		'lifetime' round until it does something.

		A 'fire object' should be put on map with start speed 0 - it
		should try to burn something in the moment it comes in the game.
		A bomb for example should be put with speed -1.0 on the map - it
		will stay then on map until the bomb becomes active - it
		explodes.

		The 'lifetime' round is determinated by speed. A speed of 1.0
		will give a 'lifetime' round of 1 tick - a speed of 0.01 100
		ticks.

		Special case: A negative speed value will add to start speed a
		random value between 0.0 to 0.9 . So, a speed of -0.1 with a
		start speed of -1.0 will result in speed 0.1 and start speed
		between -1.0 and -0.1. This is useful to let a row of same
		objects act in different tick ranges.
