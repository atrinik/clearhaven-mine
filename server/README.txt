Atrinik Server

To start your Atrinik server, you need 2 things: atrinik_server executable
and installed PYTHON scripting engine.

You can download the python script engine from the python homepage:

http://www.python.org/

On Linux system python is often pre-installed - on win32 system you usally need
to install it first. Packages for most OS there come with a nice installer
and/or as binary package. For the source package, read about it in the /make folder.

Version: Be sure your python version is at least 2.2.1. or higher.
Lower version will invoke problems with the scripts.

When you have a installed the python engine, you can install or compile the server.

To install the server you must go in the /install directory and run the installation
script for your OS. Read the README.txt in the /install directory for more info.

If you have a source package, you must compile the server first (if you have
a binary package, there are no /make and /src directories in the Atrinik/server
directory).

If you find atrinik_server executable in the same directory this README.txt is,
you can start the server (after you run the install script for your OS).
