# This file allows players on your server to become DMs.
#
# The syntax is fairly straightforward:
# name:password:host
#
# All name, password and host accept the * wildcard to match anything.
# Name is what player name to allow, password can be used in which case
# the player needs to pass the password as parameters for the /dm
# command, host is what IP to allow.
#
# The following line would allow anyone to become a DM:
#*:*:*
