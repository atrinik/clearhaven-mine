Atrinik Server Make Projects

This directory holds all official make projects to compile the Atrinik server.

Every directory holds the makefiles for a specific OS. Go in the directory for which
OS you want compile the server.

Inside the OS directory are subdirectories of the compilers or IDE's you can use.
Select the right one.

If you can't find your OS or your compiler, we haven't ported the source for your system yet.

You can try to port the source or setup a new project for a new compiler.
